# Speechy
A machine learning project to identify different speech disorders. // In development

## Currently includes:
The script for the scraper for the Youtube dataset which takes your API key and an output folder name which makes things easier to categorize for learning models.
Scrapes 50 videos and then it cuts them into 15 second segments.

## The next phase - Identification Scripts
These will use speech recognition NLP techniques to recognize speech patterns that coincide with certain disorders to help clean up the dataset.
It will only choose files that have a definite match to the patterns, otherwise it will not save them.

### Currently only have the script (basic alpha script) for Ataxic Dysarthria. Still working on it though!
